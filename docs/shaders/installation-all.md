# Installation

Because Minecraft does not officially support third-party RenderDragon Shaders, you have to use some unofficial tools/utilities to install shaders. Currently only the following platforms are supported and documented.

* [Android](installation-android)
* [Windows](installation-windows)
* [iOS](installation-ios)
* [Linux](installation-linux)
