# Installation

Because Minecraft does not officially support third-party RenderDragon shaders, you have to use some tools and programs to install shaders. 

Currently, the following platforms are supported (unofficially) by third-party shaders:

* [Android](installation-android)
* [Windows](installation-windows)
* [iOS](installation-ios)
* [Linux](installation-linux)
