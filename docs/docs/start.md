# What is RenderDragon?

RenderDragon is a new cross-platform rendering engine for Minecraft Bedrock, which was initially announced in 2019.
It includes several changes under the hood to improve the performance and graphics capabilities of Minecraft [[1]](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/render-dragon-and-nvidia-ray-tracing). One of its main features is that it supports real-time ray traced graphics on compatible RTX graphics cards.

RenderDragon is constantly improving with every update, adding new improvements and capabilities.
[Deferred Rendering Pipeline](deferred) is a new feature of RenderDragon that is currently being worked on by Minecraft.
It is expected to bring a major graphics overhaul with dynamic shadows, PBR materials, bloom, tone mapping, and other features to a wide range of platforms. [[2]](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/new-render-dragon-features-creators)

# Getting started

As of now, Minecraft Bedrock does not officially support custom shaders.
It was removed with the addition of RenderDragon on Bedrock.

The following guide will cover an unofficial way by which you can build custom shaders for RenderDragon. This was possible thanks to [ddf8196](https://github.com/ddf8196), who managed to create some utilities for building custom RenderDragon shaders.

If you, like us, also want Minecraft Bedrock to support custom shaders officially, then go ahead and upvote this [feedback post](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360077420452-3rd-party-shader-support-for-render-dragon).
