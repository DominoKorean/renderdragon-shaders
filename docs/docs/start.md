# What is RenderDragon?

RenderDragon is a new cross-platform rendering engine for Minecraft Bedrock, initially announced in 2019.
It includes several changes under the hood to improve the performance and graphics capabilities of Minecraft [[1]](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/render-dragon-and-nvidia-ray-tracing). One of its major features is support for real-time raytraced graphics on compatible RTX graphics cards.

RenderDragon is constantly improving with every update, adding new improvements and capabilities.
[Deferred Rendering Pipeline](deferred) is a new major feature of RenderDragon that is currently being worked on by Minecraft.
It is expected to bring a major graphics overhaul with dynamic shadows, PBR materials, bloom, tone mapping, and other features to a wide range of platforms. [[2]](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/new-render-dragon-features-creators)

# Getting started

As of now, Minecraft Bedrock does not officially support custom shaders.
It was removed with the addition of RenderDragon on Bedrock.
This documentation covers an unofficial way by which you can make and use custom shaders on RenderDragon. 

If you, like us, also want Minecraft Bedrock to support custom shaders officially, then go ahead and upvote this [feedback post](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360077420452-3rd-party-shader-support-for-render-dragon). 


You can make and use custom shaders on RenderDragon thanks to the efforts of [ddf8196](https://github.com/ddf8196), who managed to create some utilities for building shaders and loading them.
The following guide will cover how you can use his tools and utilities for building shaders.
